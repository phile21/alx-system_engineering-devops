Hello World - A script that prints “Hello, World”, followed by a new line to the standard output

Confused Smiley - A script that displays a confused smiley "(Ôo)'

Let's display a file - A script that displays the content of the /etc/passwd file

What about 2 - A script that displays the content of /etc/passwd and /etc/hosts

Last lines of a file - A script that displays the last 10 lines of /etc/passwd

I'd prefer the first ones actually - A script that displays the first 10 lines of /etc/passwd
